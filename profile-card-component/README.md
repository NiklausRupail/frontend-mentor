### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

using more advanced background editing 
```css
background-image: url("./images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
background-position: right calc(47vw + 15%) bottom calc(65vh - 15vw), left calc(40vw + 25%) top calc(72vh - 10vw);
```
Used pure CSS without TailwindCSS like I usually do to test myself

### Continued development

Creating transforming background from SVGs
