## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Swiftly centering the whole content with an easy two-line snippet.
```css
.center {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```
Using viewport units to create a whole-viewport container.
```css
height: 100vh;
```
### Continued development

Creating layouts with a better understanding of flexbox features and planning it better to speed up the whole process.
